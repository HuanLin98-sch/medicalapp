and bipolar mood disorder (bmd) can coexist or be mistaken for one another. bmd usually is not diagnosed until young adulthood. however studies have shown that the earlier a person is diagnosed with bmd the more likely he is to have been diagnosed with adhd previously. in this case i would just like to reiterate that there is not enough information to discuss either possibility for your son. you mentioned that he becomes hyperactive for 3 weeks but not what his behaviors are like during those 10 days. you also do not mention irritability or mood swings just adhd symptoms. keep documenting the symptoms you are concerned about including what goes on in the home and at school when you see changes in behavior (do you work those weeks does he visit a relative or have a different aide in the classroom). you also mentioned that this began 7 months ago. i would also urge you to think about what also might have changed in your son's life about that time. consulting your pediatrician or a child psychiatrist should help you unravel the mystery of your son's behavior.\n","yes it is possible to have feelings of depression if you have bpd. borderline personality disorder is frequently misdiagnosed for bipolar or manic depression. the unstable moods associated with both conditions have in fact lead some researchers to believe that they are variants of each other. mood stabilizer drugs and talk therapy seem to be the best approach to help people with borderline personality disorder manage anxiety depression and aggression. at the same time it can help those suffering from this disorder deal with daily living. talk therapy can help you focus on understanding how your thoughts and behaviors effect yourself and others. it also helps you find more effective ways for you to approach daily stressors that could trigger negative or harmful behavior.\n","yes. osteoarthritis (oa) is no more considered as a disease of aging. there are several factors that may cause oa many of
