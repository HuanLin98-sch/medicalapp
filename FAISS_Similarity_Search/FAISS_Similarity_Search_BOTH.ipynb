deafness and snorting of ears.When you take the medication, your ears are reduced; your ears are less buzzed but remain buzzed for 24 hours, but the symmetrical resonance of your ears is greater; the noise in your ears continues unabated, the night is quiet and the 16th of January of this 16th drug is again improved, the ear is less buzzing, and the noise is still constant and the night is more noisy.There was also some pain in the ears, drips were still in use, and there was pain and itch in the mouth with a tampon.Sleep and dream more.There has been little change since the beginning of the medication on 3 January, and in recent days it has been difficult to sleep and easy to wake up, with cramps and swellings on both the left and left ears, which are more pronounced, with obvious swelling pains, constant squeezing and half-cerebral echoes.The buzzing of the ears has also been constant, and when the morning wakes up, the buzzes will be softer, and the sound of the loudspeaker is stunned, the left ear is stunned or the left ear is stunned and unplugged. On 13 October, when the left ear began to suffocate, the sound of the left ear was suffocated on 15 October and the sound of the sound of the high speech was a little far away. The county examined the sound of the melancholy and the nasal hymn. It was okay to conduct the talk. On 16 October, the hearing fell a little too loud and loud to cover its ears. The city hospital said it was deaf, the membrane was fine, the skull was fine, the first day after the treatment of the acute deafile was taken, the ear was sore and the hearing recovered, and it was not easy to hear the sound of the sound. It was recently reduced by two weeks of sensitization, and it was sore in the left ear that the pain in the left ear was sore that the doctor said it was all right during the drop, and then both ears were sore that there was a little pain and nothing was seen.The hearing is almost normal for more than two months now, but the ears have been cut off from each other, sleeping in the morning is more obvious, sleeping on the right side feels a fall in the left ear, squeezing in the left ear, sounding like snowflakes without a signal from the TV, sounding with a hand on it and sounding at night when it's quiet.Sometimes early in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon, when buzzing like machines or boilers persist, there is confusion, when the loud sound of sleeping in the morning is sometimes silent, when the ear is too small or not buzzing, when the head is shaking, and sometimes when the sound of loud noises or loud noises starts to ring.Sometimes the wind blows over the head and the sound of the sun's den gets bigger, and sometimes the head hurts, a bit of snotty, suffocated, hears annoyingly, and waits for the good news! Thank you!\n","I remember your situation.

Look at the medical description and examination, mainly the low-frequency deaf form of the left ear.This type of clinical expression is dominated by a sense of suffocation, low-frequency ear ringing and resonance.Clinically, more consideration is given to the effects of a lack of internal ear veins, and there may also be some early symptoms of Menier's disease.On Thursday afternoon, 2 January, I'll be in the clinic and at 2:30 I'll be in order.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"W6xTA7UA9M00"},"source":["for i in range(len(result)):\n","  first_index = result[i][0]\n","  second_index = result[i][1]\n","\n","  first_t_q = embeddings[\"translated_ques\"][first_index]\n","  first_t_a =embeddings[\"translated_ans\"][second_index]\n","  first_q_embeddings = embeddings[\"ques_embeddings\"][first_index]\n","  first_a_embeddings = embeddings[\"ans_embeddings\"][second_index]\n","\n","  second_t_q = embeddings[\"translated_ques\"][second_index]\n","  second_t_a =embeddings[\"translated_ans\"][first_index]\n","  second_q_embeddings = embeddings[\"ques_embeddings\"][second_index]\n","  second_a_embeddings = embeddings[\"ans_embeddings\"][first_index]\n","\n","  embeddings[\"translated_ques\"].append(first_t_q)\n","  embeddings[\"translated_ans\"].append(first_t_a)\n","  embeddings[\"ques_embeddings\"].append(first_q_embeddings)\n","  embeddings[\"ans_embeddings\"].append(first_a_embeddings)\n","\n","  embeddings[\"translated_ques\"].append(second_t_q)\n","  embeddings[\"translated_ans\"].append(second_t_a)\n","  embeddings[\"ques_embeddings\"].append(second_q_embeddings)\n","  embeddings[\"ans_embeddings\"].append(second_a_embeddings)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"F02QQl6T9dO3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636605927622,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"YUEN ZHI AN _","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"04512410210882043192"}},"outputId":"a5624000-2fd9-47f0-9c0b-85eaf5398363"},"source":["print(len(embeddings[\"chi_ques\"]))\n","print(len(embeddings[\"chi_ans\"]))\n","print(len(embeddings[\"translated_ques\"]))\n","print(len(embeddings[\"translated_ans\"]))\n","print(len(embeddings[\"ques_embeddings\"]))\n","print(len(embeddings[\"ans_embeddings\"]))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["229730\n","229730\n","259604\n","259604\n","259604\n","259604\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"GCMHrH-E9fZv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1636606204156,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":17953,"user":{"displayName":"YUEN ZHI AN _","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"04512410210882043192"}}},"source":["pickle_out = open(DATA_PATH + \"/Multilingual+Lasse_embeddings.pkl\", \"wb\")\n","pickle.dump(embeddings, pickle_out, pickle.HIGHEST_PROTOCOL)\n","pickle_out.close()"],"execution_count":38,"outputs":[]}]}
